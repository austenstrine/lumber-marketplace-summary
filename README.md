# lumber-marketplace-summary
The LM codebase is private and proprietary, so I opened all the repositories in Cursor and asked Claude to describe my contributions. That's all this is.


(begin)
Do you have acces to the git commits and stuff?

If so, could you analyse the current branches in both the lumber-marketplace-admin, lumber-marketplace-backend, and pro-portals-frontend folders, and summarize the features completed by austen and outline his skills and strengths? 

Git stuff outside of these folders is irrelevant

----

Let me check if I have access to git information and analyze the branches and commits in the specified folders.

Ran tool
Great! I can see the three directories mentioned. Let me now check the git information for each folder starting with lumber-marketplace-admin.

```bash
cd lumber-marketplace-admin && git branch -a
```
Now let me look at lumber-marketplace-backend:

```bash
cd lumber-marketplace-backend && git branch -a
```
Let me check pro-portals-frontend next:

```bash
cd pro-portals-frontend && git branch -a
```
Now let me get Austen's commit history in each repository to analyze his contributions and skills. Starting with lumber-marketplace-admin:

```bash
cd lumber-marketplace-admin && git log --author="austen" --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ad : %s" --date=short
```
Let me try with a different approach since the git log command didn't show output. Let me use a more flexible pattern to match Austen's commits:

```bash
cd lumber-marketplace-admin && git log --author="[Aa]usten" --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ad : %s" --date=short
```
Let me check the lumber-marketplace-backend for Austen's commits:

```bash
cd lumber-marketplace-backend && git log --author="[Aa]usten" --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ad : %s" --date=short
```
Finally, let me check pro-portals-frontend for Austen's commits:

```bash
cd pro-portals-frontend && git log --author="[Aa]usten" --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ad : %s" --date=short
```
Now let me analyze the branches more specifically related to Austen in each repository:

```bash
cd lumber-marketplace-admin && git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(committerdate:short) %(refname:short) %(authorname)' | grep -i austen
```

```bash
cd ../lumber-marketplace-backend && git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(committerdate:short) %(refname:short) %(authorname)' | grep -i austen
```
Let me try again with the correct command:

```bash
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(committerdate:short) %(refname:short) %(authorname)' | grep -i austen
```
Let's check the pro-portals-frontend branches for Austen:

```bash
cd ../pro-portals-frontend && git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(committerdate:short) %(refname:short) %(authorname)' | grep -i austen
```
Based on the git information I've gathered, I can now provide a summary of Austen's contributions and skills:
